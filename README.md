I found these techniques very useful. I will continue focusing on them in future projects to refine and perfect them.

### Useful resources

- [React Testing Library and Jest: The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-testing-library-and-jest/?kw=je&src=sac&couponCode=LETSLEARNNOW) - This Udemy course helped me understand `Jest`, `RTL` and `TDD`. I'd recommend it to anyone learning Unit Testing.
