# RTL-Jest Test App

This is my very first project that includes testing. It takes 'name' and 'email' from input fields and adds to a dynamic table. I used this to learn/practice writing `unit tests`. This is just a test app (pun intended) with only 6 tests. I will test more sophisticated apps in future projects.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- JavaScript
- React
- React Testing Library (RTL)
- Jest
- Node.js
- Create React App

### What I learned

- I learnt basic concepts in `Jest` like:
  - Installation and setup
  - Basic syntax like `expect`
  - Assertions like `toBe`, `toEqual`, and `toContain`
  - Mocking functions and modules to isolate tests and control their behavior
  - Handling asynchronous code in tests using `async/await` or Promises.
- I learnt basic concepts in `React Testing Library (RTL)` like:
  - Installation and setup
  - Rendering components using `render` to create an instance of components and interact with it.
  - Queries: Finding elements in the DOM using queries like `getByText`, `getByRole`, and `getByTestId`.
  - User Interactions: Simulating user interactions such as clicks and typing with functions like `fireEvent` and `userEvent`.
  - Making assertions about the component's behavior and output using `expect` and queries from RTL.
  - Writing tests to verify that components render correctly and respond to user actions as expected.
  - Clean Up: Ensuring that tests do not interfere with each other by cleaning up after tests if necessary.

### Continued development

- Jest
- RTL
- TDD

I found these techniques very useful. I will continue focusing on them in future projects to refine and perfect them.

### Useful resources

- [React Testing Library and Jest: The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-testing-library-and-jest/?kw=je&src=sac&couponCode=LETSLEARNNOW) - This Udemy course helped me understand `Jest`, `RTL` and `TDD`. I'd recommend it to anyone learning Unit Testing.
